    "description": "This is a playful, Gen-Z-inspired anthem I wrote and produced during the Story Protocol Hackathon. It‚Äôs a lyrical take on the serious issue of intellectual property protection ‚Äî turning complex legal concepts into something danceable, fun, and super relatable.\r\n\r\nFrom music and comics to AI-generated content, creators today face constant challenges around ownership and rights. This song tells that story how Story Protocol helps you lock your work on-chain, set your terms, and get paid instantly when it‚Äôs used or remixed.\r\n\r\nWhether you're dropping a beat or minting an idea, Story Protocol empowers you to protect what‚Äôs yours with clarity, transparency, and vibes.\r\n\r\nLyrics, idea, and flow all created by me as part of this hackathon project.

Lock it with rules. Get your cut. No lawyers. No waiting. Just vibes and ownership.\r\n\r\nEverything‚Äîlyrics, concept, voice‚Äîcrafted by me.\r\nBecause every great story deserves to start in the right hands.",
